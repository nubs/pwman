## Installation
This package uses [composer][composer] so you can install it using composer.
Composer can install the command globally using:

composer global require nubs/pwman
```

This will install it to your `$COMPOSER_HOME` directory (typically
`$HOME/.composer`).  The `pwman` binary will be symlinked to
